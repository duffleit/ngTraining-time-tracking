# Essentials - Time Tracking

This exercise teaches the essentials and basic concepts of Angular. 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.6.

## Tasks

The tasks of this exercise are very abstract, as the solution approach is mainly driven by the needs and experiences of the workshop group. Thus this exercise is somehow special, as it acts more as a playground, then a typical recipe as the other ngTraining-exercises. 

### A Possible implementation flow could be: 

1. Create simple inputs that allow the user to enter a first time-record with a `description` and `hours`. Use the template-driven approach with `[(ngModel)]` to achieve this.

2. Create a component which renders the time-records.

3. Create a service which stores and manages the time-records. 

4. Add projects to the time-record and allow the user to select them. 

5. A dedicated route should be created which allows the user to update the projects. 

6. Pagination should be added to the time-record list. 

7. Save and fetch the data by the usage of a _real_ HTTP-server. 

8. Add a directive to format the hours correctly. 

9. Allow the user to delete records. 

10. Move the time-records form to a dedicated page and use the reactive-form. 

10. Make all subpages (time-records, projects) lazy-loaded. 

11. Replace the Http-Connection with a Mock-Implementation based on the Environment settings.
